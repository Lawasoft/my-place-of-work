            When you arrive at Arlanda you will come in the departure hall, from there you do self check in with your
            ticket. At the check in you also get a bag tag,
            put that on your bag anf then you get in que if there is one to do the bag check in, After that you go to
            the Control to get yourself checked out, usualy
            there is abit of emptying pockets and just do what the staff tells you to do.
            <br>
            Right after the control in Terminal 5 you walk right thru the taxfree area, if you want to shop you can do
            that there. they have a little of everything.
            Coming out of the taxfree you have some stores and some restaurants on the inside too. Most people check
            what gate they are suppose to be at via the monitor just outside the taxfree. Some misses it but they ask
            personel that
            <br>
            works at the airport instead, they are always happy to answer questions.
            Most question are what gate and where the toilets are, and the toilets are mostly everywhere in
            Terminal 5 atleast. The gates are as wollows, 1-10 at pier A (the middle one) and Gate 11-20 are at
            pier B (Almost all the way back to Sky City).
            <br>
            And then you have the F pier with gates 26-39 on floor 3 and thru another passport check control you
            get up on floor 4 with gates 58-69, yes Terminal 5 is big.
            There are lots of toilets all over, and some smocking boths, both floor 3 and 4 at F pier has a
            store and a coffee place.
            <br>
